🌿 Sakin — The Minimalist Phone Revolution

“Peace in your pocket.”

Sakin is a modern minimalist phone interface designed to restore mental clarity and reduce digital addiction.
It reimagines the smartphone as a tool for presence, purpose, and peace — not endless scrolling.

💡 Vision

Today’s smartphones are overloaded with noise.
Sakin brings calm, clarity, and control back to the user.
It’s not just an interface — it’s a movement toward healthier digital habits.

⚙️ Phase 1 (MVP)

The first development phase focuses on creating the core experience:

🔒 Lock Screen: Clean and mindful design — no distractions, only essentials.

🏠 Home Screen: Minimal layout with basic tools (Calls, Messages, Notes).

🌊 Zen Flick: A simple swipe feature that encourages presence and mindfulness.


Each interaction should feel calm, soft, and meaningful — designed to center the user, not scatter their focus.


---

🧠 Philosophy

Sakin follows three truths:

1. Simplicity brings peace.


2. Attention is sacred.


3. Technology must serve the mind, not consume it.

🧩 Tech & Goals

For now, the MVP may be simulated through a Google Site interface, before moving to full Android integration.
Later phases will include:

Optional Presence Practice Board

Offline-first experience

Ethical design principles



---

🤝 Collaboration

We’re currently seeking 2–3 collaborators for Phase 1, focusing on:

Frontend development (UI layout + transitions)

Simple backend / state management (if needed)

Testing and UX polish


Design concepts are ready — developers will be guided step by step.


---

🌍 Mission

Sakin isn’t just an app. It’s a declaration:

> “We choose mindfulness over manipulation. Peace over pressure.”
